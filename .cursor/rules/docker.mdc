I don't have a Ruby development environment installed, so do dev work like database migrations and running Rubocop or tests under Docker. Use the test version of Docker for this.

Use the test environment and docker-compose.test.yml files for this

docker-compose no longer uses the version: tag at the start, do not put that in files anymore.
