## Prerequisites

### Option 1: Docker (Recommended)
- Docker Engine 20.10+
- Docker Compose 2.0+

### Option 2: Native Installation
- Ruby 3.2.2
- PostgreSQL 12+
- Node.js and Yarn
- (Optional) Authentik instance for SSO

## Installation

### Docker Installation (Recommended)

The easiest way to get started is with Docker:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd EventManager

# Start all services
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d

# Access the application
open http://localhost:3000
```

That's it! The application will be running with a PostgreSQL database, migrations applied, and sample data loaded.

**Default credentials:**
- Admin: admin@example.com / password123
- User: user1@example.com / password123

For more Docker commands and troubleshooting, see [DOCKER.md](DOCKER.md).

### Native Installation

If you prefer to run without Docker:

#### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd EventManager
```

#### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
bundle install
yarn install
```

#### 3. Configure Database

Edit `config/database.yml` with your PostgreSQL credentials, or set environment variables:

```bash
export DATABASE_HOST=localhost
export DATABASE_USER=your_username
export DATABASE_PASSWORD=your_password
```

#### 4. Create and Setup Database

```bash
rails db:create
rails db:migrate
rails db:seed
```

#### 5. Configure Authentik (Optional)

If you want to use Authentik for authentication, set the following environment variables:

```bash
export AUTHENTIK_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
export AUTHENTIK_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
export AUTHENTIK_SITE_URL=https://your-authentik-instance.com
```

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```
AUTHENTIK_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
AUTHENTIK_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
AUTHENTIK_SITE_URL=https://your-authentik-instance.com
```

To use `.env` files, add `gem 'dotenv-rails'` to your Gemfile and run `bundle install`.

#### 6. Configure Slack Notifications (Optional)

EventManager can post event reminders to Slack at 9 AM on the day of each event. To enable this:

1. **Create a Slack Incoming Webhook:**
   - Go to https://api.slack.com/apps
   - Create a new app or select an existing one
   - Navigate to "Incoming Webhooks" and activate it
   - Click "Add New Webhook to Workspace"
   - Select the channel (e.g., `#announcements`) where reminders should be posted
   - Copy the webhook URL

2. **Set the environment variable:**
   ```bash
   export SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL=https://hooks.slack.com/services/YOUR/WEBHOOK/URL
   ```

   Or add it to your `.env` file:
   ```
   SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL=https://hooks.slack.com/services/YOUR/WEBHOOK/URL
   ```

3. **Set the application host (for event links in Slack messages):**
   ```bash
   export RAILS_HOST=your-domain.com
   export RAILS_PROTOCOL=https  # or http for development
   ```

   Or in `.env`:
   ```
   RAILS_HOST=your-domain.com
   RAILS_PROTOCOL=https
   ```

4. **Enable Slack in Site Configuration:**
   - Sign in as an admin
   - Go to Site Configuration
   - Check "Enable Slack Notifications"
   - Save

5. **Enable Slack announcements for events:**
   - When creating or editing an event, check "Post to Slack"
   - Reminders will only be posted for public and members-only events (not private or draft events)

**Note:** The Slack reminder job runs daily at 9 AM via Sidekiq. Make sure Sidekiq is running for reminders to be posted.

#### 7. Configure Social Media Reminders (Optional)

Social media reminders post to Instagram and Bluesky one week and one day prior to each event at 10 AM. To enable them:

1. **Set the environment variables:**
   ```bash
   export INSTAGRAM_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_instagram_token
   export INSTAGRAM_PAGE_ID=your_instagram_page_id
   export BLUESKY_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_bluesky_token
   export BLUESKY_HANDLE=your_bluesky_handle
   ```

   Or add them to your `.env` file:
   ```
   INSTAGRAM_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_instagram_token
   INSTAGRAM_PAGE_ID=your_instagram_page_id
   BLUESKY_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_bluesky_token
   BLUESKY_HANDLE=your_bluesky_handle
   ```

2. **Enable social reminders in Site Configuration:** check “Enable Social Media Reminders”.
3. **Enable the flag on individual events:** check “Post to Social Media” when creating/editing (only public or members-only events will post).

**Note:** The social reminder job runs daily at 10 AM via Sidekiq.

#### 8. Configure AI Reminder Generation (Optional)

If you want Ollama to craft flavorful reminder copy, set:

```
export OLLAMA_SERVER=http://localhost:11434
```

Or add to `.env`:

```
OLLAMA_SERVER=http://localhost:11434
```

This server is queried to generate AI text a week or a day before each event, using the event description, time, and the fact that it's at PDX Hackerspace.

#### 9. Start the Application

Development mode with asset compilation:

```bash
./bin/dev
```

Or manually:

```bash
# Terminal 1 - Rails server
rails server

# Terminal 2 - Asset compilation
yarn build
yarn watch:css
```

#### 9. Access the Application

Open your browser and navigate to:

```
http://localhost:3000
```

## Default User Accounts

After running `rails db:seed`, you'll have these accounts:

- **Admin**: admin@example.com / password123
- **User 1**: user1@example.com / password123
- **User 2**: user2@example.com / password123

## Usage

### Creating Events

1. Sign in to your account
2. Click "New Event" in the navigation bar
3. Fill in the event details:
   - Title and description
   - Start date/time and duration
   - Recurrence pattern (if applicable)
4. Save the event

### Managing Events

Event owners and admins can:
- Edit event details
- Postpone events (with a reason)
- Cancel events (with a reason)
- Reactivate postponed/cancelled events
- Delete events

### Subscribing to Events

Each event has a unique iCal feed URL that can be added to calendar applications:

1. Navigate to an event
2. Click "iCal Feed" button
3. Copy the URL or click to download
4. Add to your calendar app (Google Calendar, Apple Calendar, Outlook, etc.)

For recurring events, the iCal feed will include all occurrences for the next year.

### User Management (Admin Only)

Admins can access the user management dashboard at `/users` to:
- View all registered users
- Edit user profiles
- Promote users to admin
- Delete users

## Recurrence Patterns

The system uses the `ice_cube` gem to handle complex recurring events:

### Weekly Events
Select specific days of the week (e.g., every Tuesday and Thursday)

### Monthly Events
Choose patterns like:
- First Tuesday of every month
- Third Monday of every month
- Last Friday of every month

### Custom Patterns
Extend the `Event.build_schedule` method in `app/models/event.rb` for custom recurrence rules.

## Authentik Integration

### Setting up Authentik Provider

1. Log in to your Authentik admin panel
2. Navigate to Applications → Providers
3. Create a new OAuth2/OpenID Provider:
   - Name: EventManager
   - Client Type: Confidential
   - Redirect URIs: `http://localhost:3000/users/auth/authentik/callback` (adjust for production)
4. Note the Client ID and Client Secret
5. Create an Application and link it to the provider
6. Update your environment variables with the credentials

## Deployment

### Production Setup

1. Set production environment variables:
   - `SECRET_KEY_BASE`
   - `DATABASE_URL`
   - `AUTHENTIK_*` variables (if using)

2. Precompile assets:
   ```bash
   RAILS_ENV=production rails assets:precompile
   ```

3. Run migrations:
   ```bash
   RAILS_ENV=production rails db:migrate
   ```

4. Update `config/environments/production.rb` with your production domain for Devise mailer.
